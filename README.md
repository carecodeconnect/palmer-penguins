# Palmer Penguins

This is a simple example of a Streamlit app using the Palmer Penguins dataset.

The Palmer Penguins dataset is a popular dataset for data exploration and visualization. The dataset contains various measurements of penguins, including bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and species.

In this example, we use the Palmer Penguins dataset to create a simple Streamlit app that includes a bar chart, scatter plot, violin plots, and a YouTube video.
